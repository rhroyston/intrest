## Synopsis

Manage and configure a Cisco networking device using a pleasing Material Design Lite browser based GUI.

:construction: **This project is currently being developed.  It is not yet in beta.  Please check back soon!**

## Code Example

Screenshot will go here.

## Motivation

A continuing interest in Web development and experience with Cisco IOS.  When I learned of Cisco's REST API for IOS I immediately wanted to flesh out a browser based project.

## Installation

:checkered_flag: More to come

## API Reference

This project is a custom browser based front end for interacting with Cisco's REST API.  I do not anticipate exposing any API myself at this time, rather this project will be interacting with Cisco's REST API.
